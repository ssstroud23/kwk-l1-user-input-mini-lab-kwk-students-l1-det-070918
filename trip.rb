# Code your prompts here!

# First, puts out a string asking where the tourist would like to stay.
puts "Let's plan your trip! Where would you like to stay?"

# Then, set a variable called stay to get the user's input. Make sure to capitilize that input.

#don't forget to Capitilize the input

# Do the same thing with `eats` and one last time with `nights`, capturing their text input and storing them to the respective local variable
